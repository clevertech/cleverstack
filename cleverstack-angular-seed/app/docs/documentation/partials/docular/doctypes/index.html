<p>Things to know about  <code>docTypes</code> .</p>

<ol>
<li> <code>DocTypes</code>  are what Docular uses to determine how to render the document.</p></li>
<li> <code>DocTypes</code>  are the value specified next to the  <code>documentation identifier</code> .</p></li>
</ol>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**
 * &#64;ngdoc directive
 */
</pre>

<p>So in the above example "@ngdoc" is the  <code>documentation identifier</code>  and "directive" is the  <code>docType</code> .  And this would be like saying hey "@ngdoc" plugin, I want you to render this document as a "directive". Then the "@ngdoc" plugin would say, "Dude, no problem, I'm on it."</p>

<h3 id="doctypesneedparamstorender">DocTypes Need Params to Render</h4>

<p>So just because you said "Yo! Render a service for me." doesn't mean the plugin will be able to. You may need to provide some mandatory and/or optional parameters by giving it the proper "@&lt;key&gt;" value pairs. Check out the next two sections to see the types of params expected for each docType.</p>
