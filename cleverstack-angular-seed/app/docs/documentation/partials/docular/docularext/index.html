<p>Docular can be extended in multiple way to customize the parsing, object creation, rendering, and behavior and styling of documentation. By default it ships with the "@doc" extension which provides basic parsing and rendering configurations. It also ships with the "@ngdoc" extension which extends the basics with AngularJS specific parsing and rendering functionality. Check out some of the details of the code here. This is a great place to start if you want to create your own extension.</p>
