<h1><code ng:non-bindable="">Naming and Ids</code>
<span class="hint"></span>
</h1>
<div><p>Docular follows a basic naming convention for each document object. This naming convention helps you split up your documentation objects into <code>overviews</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>module sections</code>, <code>items</code>, and <code>sub items</code>.</p>

<h2 id="whatsinaname">What's in a Name?</h3>

<p>Each document you create will eventually get a  <code>name</code>  and  <code>id</code>  after the parsing process. The  <code>id</code>  is the system id used and appears in the URL.  The  <code>name</code>  attribute is used most often within the ui as user friendly text.</p>

<p>The "@id" value is what is considered along with the doc type to determine which bucket your documentation object goes into.</p>

<p>But in many examples (especially in Angular source code), there isn't an "@id", just a "@name". This is done out of convenience. The "@name" key value pair will be copied into the "@id" attribute if one is not provided. Therefore, you can quickly just give the name and have it be both the  <code>name</code>  and the  <code>id</code>  so it appears in the documentation title and serves as a unique identifier for the document.</p>

<h2 id="thetwomainbucketsfordocs">The Two Main Buckets for Docs</h3>

<p>At the top level, there are two major bucket types:</p>

<ol>
<li> <code>Overview</code>  : This bucket holds general documentation that lives outside of modules</li>
<li> <code>Module</code>  : This holds documentation relevant to a specific module</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="puttingdocsintotheoverviewbucket">Putting Docs into the Overview Bucket</h3>

<p>First note that all the docs in this section of the tutorial are in the "overview" bucket. In the little nav area in the upper
left hand corner you can see each of the docs in this section.</p>

<p>To get a doc into the overview bucket for a documentation section, do this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**
 * @doc overview
 * @id myId
 * @name This is just a title
 * @description Here is where I put all my
 * crazy overview documentation.
 *
 * ## I can use markdown here!
 */


</pre>

<p>The key part is the "@doc overview". The "overview" doctype tells Docular this doc is going into the general "overview" bucket regardless of what the "@id" or "@name" is.</p>

<p>Notice here we specify an "@id" and a "@name". The "@name" is user friendly text shown in the UI, whereas the "@id" attribute becomes the system utilized id
and shows up in the url. And again, having "@doc overview" is where the magic occurs to put this into a general "overview" bucket of documentation.</p>

<p>It is possible to <a href="documentation/docular/docularconfigure/sections">rank these overview documentation objects</a> which is helpful for creating ordered step by step documenation such as this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="puttingdocsintomodules">Putting Docs into Modules</h3>

<p>Here is the default naming pattern:</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
 <code>module</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>module section</code>   <code>:</code>   <code>item</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>sub-item</code> 
</div>

<p>Module and module section patterns are mostly self explanatory so we should dicuss item and sub-item a bit more in depth. First note that  <code>sub-item</code>  is optional. It gives you one more level of grouping and relationship. A good way to use this extra grouping would be to create a base element and then extend it. So your base element would be  <code>item</code>  and your extensions would be  <code>sub-item</code> . Of course it is really up to you what conventions you want to you use!</p>

<p>So in general the combination of  <code>item</code>  or  <code>item</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>sub-item</code> , could just be considered the unique id for this object within the  <code>module</code>  and  <code>module section</code> .</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>Here are a few examples of sticking docs into the "itemView" module within different module sections like "service", "factory", "global", and "directive":</p>

<ol>
<li>@name itemView.service:items</li>
<li>@name itemView.factory:user</li>
<li>@name itemView.global:parseUsers</li>
<li>@name itemView.directive:input</li>
<li>@name itemView.directive:input.checkbox</li>
<li>@name itemView.directive:input.select</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-info"><i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i> REMEMBER! You are actually encouraged to only use the @name attribute to store the "id" and it will automatically populate into the "@id" field during parsing</div>

<h2 id="iclassiconcameraipicturethis"><i class="icon-camera"></i> Picture This</h3>

<p>Here is a picture with labels that indicate the different parts of the naming pattern for <a href="/documentation/angular/api/ng.directive:input.checkbox">AngularJS Input CheckBox Directive</a> and how they are represented in the UI:</p>

<p>&#64;name  <code>ng</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>directive</code>   <code>:</code>   <code>input</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>checkbox</code> 

<p><img src="/resources/img/docular/module_sections.png"/></p>

<p>For another example, the "input" directive right above the "input.checkbox" directive would simply be:</p>

<p>&#64;name  <code>ng</code>   <code>.</code>   <code>directive</code>   <code>:</code>   <code>input</code> 

<h2 id="warningthengdocdocumentationpluginisacheater">WARNING : The @ngdoc Documentation Plugin is a Cheater</h3>

<p>So the naming convention above is what should generally be followed, however AngularJS has additional conventions that are enforced that do not follow the typical naming conventions but that still do put their document objects into modules and module-sections.</p>

<p>For instance,  <code class="plain">@name ng.$anchorScroll</code>  looks incomplete, but extra rules in the documentation plugin see the dollar sign (  <code class="plain">$</code>  ) and automatically assume that this is a service and turn it into  <code class="plain">@name ng.service:$anchorScroll</code> .</p>

<p>Feel free to take advantage of this if you please or just stick the naming convention mentioned above.</p>
