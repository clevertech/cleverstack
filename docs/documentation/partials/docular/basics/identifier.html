<h1><code ng:non-bindable="">Documentation Identifiers</code>
<span class="hint"></span>
</h1>
<div><p>Take our previous example of documentation within a comment block.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**
 * @doc function
 * @name myModule.moduleSection:thisIsAFunction
 *
 * @description This function rules!
 *
 * This is still part of the description!!!
 */
</pre>

<p>The <code>documentation identifier</code> in this example would be "@doc".</p>

<p>The word "function" which comes right after "@doc" is the  <code>doctype</code> .
The  <code>doctype</code>  in most cases tells Docular what rendering method to use, but don't worry about that right now, we'll get into that more later. Let's focus on the identifier attribute for now.</p>

<p>The documentation identifier signifies the start of a new documentation object. It also tells Docular
which <code>documentation plugin</code> should be used to parse, manipulate, and display the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="docthedefaultdocumentationidentifier">@doc, The Default Documentation Identifier</h3>

<p>The default documentation identifier is "@doc". This triggers the use of the default documentation plugin which allows for basic support to group documentation into modules, and then within modules you can further group into <code>classes</code> and <code>globals</code>.  It gives a standard view of functions, methods, return values, and parameters.</p>

<h2 id="ngdoctheangularjsdocumentationidentifier">@ngdoc, The AngularJS Documentation Identifier</h3>

<p>The "@ngdoc" identifier tells Docular to use the AngularJS plugin to parse, manipulate, and render your documentation. It supports different groupings within modules like <code>services</code>, <code>filters</code>, <code>directives</code>, and <code>types</code>.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">All documentatio plugins inherit from the default @doc plugin</div>

<p>This means that the AngularJS documentation plugin inherits everything from the default documentation plugin including the ability to split docs into the classes module section.</p>

<p>A sample of what an AngularJS doc would look like using "&#64;ngdoc" identifier would be:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**
 * &#64;ngdoc service
 * &#64;name myModule.service:myService
 * &#64;description This is the best service ever!!
 *
 * ## No Really it's sweet!
 */
</pre>

<p>The basis of the @doc plugin along with the additions of the @ngdoc plugin gives the final logic to parse, maniuplate, and display documentation just the way it is done on the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/">AngulerJS documentation site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="otherdocumentationplugins">Other Documentation Plugins?</h3>

<p>Well, there aren't any yet, but if you are feeling frisky, you can certainly make your own. The documentation for creating a documentation plugin is <a href="documentation/docular/basics/booyah">here</a>. (not done yet)</p>

<p>As new plugins become available they will have their own documentation identifier that must take the form "@doc-somename". So suppose I wanted to create my own plugin to parse, manipulate, and display documentation for PHP.  The plugin could specify that it's documentation identifier would be "@doc-php".  Then all documentation would be scanned and if the documentation section had an identifier of "@doc-php" it would use the API that results from the new plugin that inherited from the default "@doc" api.</p>
