<span class="hint"></span>

<div><p>Docular parses your script files ( <a href="documentation/docular/docularconfigure/sections">designated in your Grunt config</a> ), and looks for documentation that live
within blocked comments. A block comment looks like this:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
/**
 * This is a block comment
 */

/**
 * This is a multi
 * line block comment
 */

</pre>

<h2 id="sampledocumentationwithincommentblocks">Sample Documentation Within Comment Blocks</h3>

<p>Here is an example of Docular documentation within comment blocks within a script file:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
//this comment is ignored because it is not in a block

/**
 * @doc function
 * @name myModule.moduleSection:thisIsAFunction
 *
 * @description This function rules!
 *
 * This is still part of the description!!!
 */

var thisIsAFunction = function () {};

</pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>So here are a few points to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>Documentation is parsed as key value pairs</li>
<li>Each @ represents a key. So @description designates the "description" key</li>
<li>Text following the key on the same line and text on following lines before the next @ will be the value for that key</li>
<li>Comments delimeted by // are not parsed so you can essentially separate your documentation comments
from other inline comments that would best be suited for those scanning code instead of learning about your APIs.</li>
</ol>
