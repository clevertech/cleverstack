<h1><code ng:non-bindable="">How the heck do I create an "@ngdoc" service?</code>
<span class="hint"></span>
</h1>
<div><p>Docular is still built to parse the original AngularJS source code to provide as close to the same documentation as seen on the AngularJS site.</p>

<p>Therefore, following the AngularJS code as an example for Docular is perfectly fine with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>AngularJS has a few special naming conventions of their document ids that do not follow "the rules".</p>

<p>If you look at the AngularJS source, you see this example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">/**
 * @ngdoc function
 * @name ng.$anchorScroll
 * @requires $window
 * @requires $location
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * When called, it checks current value of `$location.hash()` and scroll to related element,
 * according to rules specified in
 * {@link http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-indicated-part-of-the-document Html5 spec}.
 *
 * It also watches the `$location.hash()` and scroll whenever it changes to match any anchor.
 * This can be disabled by calling `$anchorScrollProvider.disableAutoScrolling()`.
 */
</pre>

<p>This is the documentation syntax for the anchorScroll service. You notice however, that AngularJS has a naming convention that assumes that anything that has this form "<moduleName>.$<someName>", is a service. So behind the scenes it would turn "&lt;moduleName&gt;.$&lt;someName&gt;" into our <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/naming">normal naming convention</a> of "&lt;moduleName&gt;.service:&lt;someName&gt;".</p>

<p>Therefore, you have two choices in putting documentation objects into the "service" <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/sections">module section</a>. You can either follow the "$" prefix and not specify a <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/sections">module section</a>, or you can use the <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/naming">normal naming convention</a> and provide the <a href="/documentation/docular/basics/sections">module section</a>.</p>
